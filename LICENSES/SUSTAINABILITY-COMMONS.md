# Sustainability Commons License

## Purpose

The Sustainability Commons logic embeds ecological accounting and routing mechanisms directly into AI licensing and service agreements. It ensures that the environmental costs of AI systems—particularly energy consumption and carbon emissions—are measured, reported, and constrained through contractual obligations.

## Core Principle

Sustainability Commons clauses require that compute providers, model developers, and deployers measure and disclose the ecological footprint of AI systems, set limits on resource consumption, and route workloads to minimize environmental impact.

## Key Mechanisms

### Ecological Accounting

- Mandatory measurement of energy consumption per inference or training run

- Carbon intensity reporting based on grid mix and data center location

- Water usage tracking for cooling systems

- Hardware lifecycle and e-waste accounting

### Resource Constraints

- Maximum energy budgets for specific workload types

- Carbon caps per model or deployment

- Preferential routing to renewable-powered infrastructure

- Efficiency requirements for model architecture

### Routing and Optimization

- Workload scheduling to match renewable energy availability

- Geographic distribution to minimize carbon intensity

- Pruning and quantization requirements for deployment

- Incentives for energy-efficient model design

## Application Scenarios

### 1. Distributed Compute Networks

Distributed compute providers implement "AIC-S" (AI Commons - Sustainability) compliance badges, certifying energy measurement, renewable preference, and carbon reporting for all nodes.

### 2. Hyperscale Cloud Training

Cloud providers offer "Sustainability Commons – Training" profiles that guarantee maximum carbon budgets per training run, with automatic workload migration to renewable-powered regions.

### 3. Logistics Optimization SaaS

AI-powered logistics platforms commit to sustainability reporting, demonstrating that emissions saved through optimized routing exceed the carbon cost of running the AI system.

## Why Adopt

**For Providers:**

- Differentiates offerings in sustainability-conscious markets

- Aligns with corporate climate commitments

- Prepares for emerging environmental regulations

- Reduces operational costs through efficiency

**For Deployers:**

- Enables credible environmental impact reporting

- Supports scope 3 emissions accounting

- Demonstrates environmental responsibility to stakeholders

- Potentially qualifies for green procurement preferences

**For the Planet:**

- Reduces AI's growing environmental footprint

- Accelerates transition to renewable-powered compute

- Creates accountability for hidden environmental costs

- Aligns AI development with planetary boundaries

## Key Requirements

### Measurement Standards

- Energy consumption per training run, inference, or query

- Carbon emissions using grid-mix data or power purchase agreements

- Water usage for cooling (where applicable)

- Hardware manufacturing and disposal impacts

### Reporting Obligations

- Monthly sustainability reports in standardized formats

- Real-time energy dashboards for large deployments

- Annual lifecycle assessments for major model releases

- Public disclosure of aggregate environmental metrics

### Performance Commitments

- Maximum energy per unit of compute

- Renewable energy percentage targets

- Carbon intensity thresholds

- Efficiency improvement roadmaps

### Routing Requirements

- Preferential scheduling during renewable energy peaks

- Geographic distribution to low-carbon regions

- Workload deferral for non-urgent tasks

- Efficiency-first model architecture choices

## Relation to Other Commons

Sustainability Commons integrates with:

- **Transparency Commons**: by standardizing environmental reporting

- **Access Commons**: by ensuring sustainable infrastructure is accessible

- **Governance Commons**: by creating oversight for environmental commitments

- **Value Commons**: by accounting for environmental externalities in value distribution
