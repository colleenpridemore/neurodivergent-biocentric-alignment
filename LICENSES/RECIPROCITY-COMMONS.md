# Reciprocity Commons License

## Purpose

The Reciprocity Commons logic recognizes and rewards contributions along the entire AI value chain. It addresses the challenge that current licensing often obscures the many contributors—data creators, annotators, content producers, infrastructure providers—whose work enables AI systems but who receive no share of downstream value.

## Core Principle

Reciprocity Commons clauses embed mechanisms for tracing contributions and routing portions of revenue or value back to contributors. This creates visible, auditable pathways from AI-generated value to the humans and communities whose labor, creativity, and data made that value possible.

## Key Mechanisms

### Contribution Tracking

- Immutable records of data provenance and use

- Attribution chains for training data sources

- Creator identification for synthetic content generation

- Labor accounting for human feedback and annotation

### Value Distribution

- Percentage-based revenue sharing with contributors

- Micropayments or pooled dividends for creators

- Recognition and compensation for data contributors

- Fair allocation based on contribution metrics

### Implementation Approaches

- On-chain/distributed ledger for transparent tracking

- Smart contracts for automated distribution

- Pooled funds with governance-based allocation

- Platform-mediated revenue sharing

## Application Scenarios

### 1. AI Services Marketplace

A distributed AI marketplace uses on-chain reciprocity to route portions of revenue to infrastructure providers, model developers, and dataset contributors, with transparent, automated distribution.

### 2. Publisher Platforms with AI Features

Online publishing platforms offering AI-assisted editing, translation, or summarization route percentage of subscriber revenue to author dividend pools, distributed based on whose works were used for training.

### 3. Image Generation Platform

AI image generators identify artistic styles used in outputs and route portion of subscription revenue to funds managed by artist collectives representing those styles, with dividends to contributing artists.

## Why Adopt

**For Platforms:**

- Differentiates as ethical alternative to extractive models

- Builds trust with creator communities

- Reduces legal risk from copyright and compensation claims

- Aligns with emerging "right to fair compensation" frameworks

- Attracts quality contributors and content

**For Contributors:**

- Provides fair compensation for data and creative work

- Creates ongoing revenue streams from AI use of contributions

- Offers visibility into how contributions are used

- Builds economic sustainability for creative labor

- Recognizes value of data and labor often rendered invisible

**For Ecosystems:**

- Creates sustainable economic models for data commons

- Incentivizes high-quality contributions

- Reduces exploitation and extractive data practices

- Aligns economic incentives with ethical values

- Builds trust between AI developers and communities

## Key Requirements

### Contribution Attribution

- Granular tracking of training data sources

- Creator identification for content-based models

- Labor accounting for human-in-the-loop systems

- Provenance records for datasets and corpora

### Distribution Mechanisms

- Clear formulas for revenue or value allocation

- Transparent accounting of distributions

- Regular payment schedules

- Minimum thresholds and pooling for micro-contributions

- Accessible claims and verification processes

### Governance

- Multi-stakeholder oversight of allocation formulas

- Dispute resolution mechanisms

- Regular review of fairness and impact

- Contributor representation in decision-making

### Technical Infrastructure

- Robust tracking systems (blockchain, distributed ledgers, databases)

- Automated distribution where feasible

- Auditable records of contributions and payments

- Privacy-preserving attribution where needed

## Contribution Types Recognized

### Data Contributions

- Training data creation

- Data annotation and labeling

- Dataset curation and cleaning

- Synthetic data generation

### Creative Contributions

- Artwork, writing, music used in training

- Stylistic influences in generative models

- Performance or motion capture data

- Photographic or visual content

### Labor Contributions

- Human feedback (RLHF) participants

- Red-teaming and evaluation

- Content moderation training

- Edge case identification

### Infrastructure Contributions

- Compute resource providers

- Model hosting and serving

- Network and bandwidth provision

- Tool and framework development

## Relation to Other Commons

Reciprocity Commons supports:

- **Value Commons**: by extending value distribution to the full contribution chain

- **Transparency Commons**: by requiring visible attribution and accounting

- **Access Commons**: by recognizing non-monetary contributions (e.g., research access in exchange for data)

- **Governance Commons**: by giving contributors standing in oversight structures

## Implementation

This license can be adopted individually or combined with other Commons licenses. License holders may:

- Implement contribution tracking infrastructure

- Establish revenue-sharing percentages and formulas

- Create transparent distribution mechanisms

- Build governance structures for allocation decisions

- Develop technical systems for automated distribution
