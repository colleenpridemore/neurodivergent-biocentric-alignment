# Access Commons License

## Purpose

The Access Commons logic defines conditions of meaningful use for AI systems, ensuring that powerful capabilities are not locked exclusively behind commercial paywalls. It creates structured pathways for public-interest actors, researchers, educators, and underserved communities to access AI infrastructure and services.

## Core Principle

Access Commons clauses embed tiered access mechanisms into licensing and service agreements, reserving capacity or offering preferential terms for specific user groups. This builds shared access infrastructure while maintaining sustainable business models for providers.

## Key Mechanisms

### Tiered Access Models

- **Public-Interest Tier**: Free or subsidized access for qualifying organizations

- **Research Access**: Dedicated capacity for academic and non-commercial research

- **Educational Access**: Special terms for schools, libraries, and learning platforms

- **Community Tier**: Preferential pricing for community organizations and NGOs

### Capacity Reservation

- Guaranteed percentage of compute reserved for non-commercial use

- Priority queuing for public-interest workloads

- Dedicated infrastructure for long-term research projects

- Shared resource pools with governance mechanisms

### Qualification Criteria

- Transparent eligibility requirements

- Application and review processes

- Usage monitoring and compliance

- Renewal and reporting obligations

## Application Scenarios

### 1. Foundation Model API

A major AI provider offers a "Public-Interest Tier" with free API access (subject to reasonable rate limits) for registered non-profits, public-interest journalism, human rights organizations, and accredited researchers.

### 2. AI Services Marketplace

A distributed AI marketplace maintains an "Access Commons Pool" funded by commercial revenue surcharges, providing vouchers for qualifying community organizations, educational institutions, and public-health initiatives.

### 3. Research Compute Facility

A shared computing facility reserves 20% of capacity for Access Commons users, with governance by a multi-stakeholder board and transparent allocation based on research value and public benefit.

## Why Adopt

**For Providers:**

- Demonstrates social responsibility and public benefit commitment

- Builds goodwill and reputation with stakeholders

- May qualify for tax benefits or public funding

- Creates pipeline for future commercial partnerships

- Supports research that validates and improves models

**For Public-Interest Users:**

- Reduces financial barriers to AI adoption

- Enables innovation by under-resourced organizations

- Supports mission-critical applications in health, education, environment

- Builds capacity in sectors underserved by commercial markets

**For Society:**

- Democratizes access to transformative AI capabilities

- Enables public-interest applications that commercial markets won't serve

- Supports research and education without commercial conflicts

- Reduces AI inequality between well-funded and under-resourced sectors

## Key Requirements

### Eligibility Criteria (Examples)

- Registered non-profit or charitable status

- Public institution (schools, libraries, government agencies)

- Accredited academic research

- Verified community organization or NGO

- Public-interest journalism outlet

- Open-source project with public benefit

### Usage Conditions

- Non-commercial use only (or limited commercial use with revenue sharing)

- Attribution and acknowledgment requirements

- Compliance with ethical use guidelines

- Reporting on impacts and outcomes

- No resale or sublicensing of access

### Capacity Commitments

- Minimum percentage of total capacity reserved

- Maximum response times for access requests

- Fair allocation mechanisms when demand exceeds capacity

- Transparent criteria for prioritization

### Governance

- Multi-stakeholder oversight of allocation decisions

- Regular review of eligibility criteria

- Public reporting on access metrics and impacts

- Mechanisms for dispute resolution

## Relation to Other Commons

Access Commons connects with:

- **Value Commons**: by ensuring automation benefits reach underserved communities

- **Transparency Commons**: by requiring public reporting on access allocation

- **Governance Commons**: by creating participatory oversight structures

- **Reciprocity Commons**: by recognizing contributions from public-interest users

## Implementation

This license can be adopted individually or combined with other Commons licenses. License holders may:

- Establish public-interest access tiers

- Reserve capacity for non-commercial use

- Create transparent eligibility and allocation processes

- Implement governance structures for access decisions

- Report publicly on access metrics and impacts
