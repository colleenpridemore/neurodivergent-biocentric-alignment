# Governance Commons License

## Purpose

The Governance Commons logic creates hooks for ongoing multi-stakeholder oversight of AI systems beyond individual contracts. It embeds participatory governance structures directly into licensing and service agreements, giving affected communities, users, and stakeholders meaningful voice in how AI systems are deployed, monitored, and modified.

## Core Principle

Governance Commons clauses establish durable oversight bodies—boards, councils, committees—with defined powers, composition, and operating procedures. These structures persist across the AI system's lifecycle, creating accountability mechanisms that transcend bilateral provider-deployer relationships.

## Key Mechanisms

### Oversight Bodies

- Multi-stakeholder boards with diverse representation

- Community councils with decision-making authority

- Advisory committees with consultation rights

- Technical review panels for ongoing evaluation

### Powers and Responsibilities

- Authority to review system performance and impacts

- Input on system modifications and updates

- Power to investigate complaints and incidents

- Ability to recommend or require changes

- In some cases, authority to suspend or terminate deployments

### Composition Requirements

- Mandatory inclusion of affected community representatives

- Balance between technical experts and impacted stakeholders

- Independence from sole provider or deployer control

- Diverse perspectives including marginalized voices

### Operating Procedures

- Regular meeting schedules

- Transparent decision-making processes

- Public reporting requirements

- Conflict resolution mechanisms

## Application Scenarios

### 1. Neighborhood Camera Systems

A community surveillance system includes a residents' board with authority to review footage policies, adjust retention periods, and approve or reject new features, with contractual guarantees of access to system logs and performance data.

### 2. School AI Homework Helpers

An AI tutoring system used in schools establishes a parent-teacher council that meets quarterly to review usage data, equity metrics, and educational outcomes, with power to modify or discontinue use based on evidence of harm.

### 3. Blockchain-Based Trading Bots

An AI trading platform creates an on-chain oversight DAO where token holders can propose and vote on risk parameters, trading strategies, and system modifications, with binding authority over the AI agent's behavior.

## Why Adopt

**For Deployers:**

- Builds trust with affected communities

- Provides early warning system for problems

- Distributes liability and responsibility

- Demonstrates commitment to ethical deployment

- Reduces risk of backlash or resistance

**For Providers:**

- Creates sustainable long-term relationships with clients

- Differentiates as responsible AI leader

- Gathers valuable feedback for improvement

- Reduces reputational risk

- May satisfy regulatory requirements

**For Communities:**

- Provides meaningful voice in AI governance

- Creates accountability beyond contracts

- Enables collective action and representation

- Protects against harms and unilateral changes

- Builds democratic oversight of automated systems

## Key Requirements

### Composition

- Minimum percentage from affected communities or stakeholder groups

- Maximum percentage from any single organization

- Requirements for diversity (demographic, expertise, perspective)

- Terms limits and rotation to ensure fresh perspectives

- Provisions for removing and replacing members

### Powers

- Access to system documentation and performance data

- Right to commission independent audits

- Authority to review and approve significant changes

- Power to investigate complaints

- Ability to recommend or require modifications

- In strong versions: authority to suspend or terminate

### Procedures

- Minimum meeting frequency

- Quorum requirements for decisions

- Decision-making processes (consensus, majority vote, etc.)

- Public reporting and transparency obligations

- Complaint intake and investigation protocols

- Escalation and dispute resolution mechanisms

### Provider/Deployer Obligations

- Funding for oversight body operations

- Technical support for accessing data and documentation

- Timely response to oversight body requests

- Implementation of decisions within defined timeframes

- Prohibition on retaliation against oversight members

## Governance Models

### Advisory Model

- Oversight body provides recommendations

- Provider/deployer retains final decision authority

- Transparency requirements ensure accountability

- Useful for lower-risk systems or early adoption

### Co-Governance Model

- Oversight body has veto power over specific decisions

- Shared authority between provider, deployer, and stakeholders

- Balanced for moderate-risk systems

- Creates checks and balances

### Community Control Model

- Oversight body has binding authority over key decisions

- Provider/deployer acts on behalf of community governance

- Appropriate for high-impact community-facing systems

- Strongest form of participatory governance

## Relation to Other Commons

Governance Commons enables:

- **Value Commons**: by providing oversight of fund management and distribution

- **Transparency Commons**: by ensuring documentation is produced and accessible

- **Sustainability Commons**: by monitoring environmental commitments

- **Access Commons**: by governing allocation decisions

- **Reciprocity Commons**: by overseeing fair distribution to contributors
