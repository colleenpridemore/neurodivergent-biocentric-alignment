# Value Commons License

## Purpose

The Value Commons logic targets the distribution of economic gains from AI-enabled automation. It helps channel part of those gains towards workers, communities, or shared infrastructures that would otherwise be excluded from meaningful participation in the productivity gains their work, data, and environments help generate.

## Core Principle

Under a Value Commons license, efficiency gains from AI automation are not treated as purely bilateral matters between provider and deployer. Instead, a portion of documented cost savings is contractually channeled into transition and innovation funds for affected stakeholders.

## Key Mechanisms

### Value Sharing

- Fixed percentage of annual savings above agreed baseline is paid into shared funds

- Applies for the duration of the contract or deployment

### Eligible Uses

- Retraining into higher-skill roles

- Internal mobility programmes

- Early-retirement packages

- Worker-led innovation projects

- Community infrastructure development

### Governance Provisions

- Representatives of affected stakeholders sit on fund steering groups

- Annual summaries of contributions and disbursements made available

- Transparency to regulators, works councils, or community boards where appropriate

## Application Scenarios

### 1. Enterprise Automation

When AI-based toolchains reduce person-years of work by an order of magnitude, a portion of savings funds transition programmes for affected staff.

### 2. Foundation Model Ecosystems

Revenue from commercial deployments of foundational AGI systems channels portions back to public infrastructure, basic income programmes, or community development in underserved regions.

### 3. Creative Industries

AI-generated content platforms route percentage of subscription revenue to funds supporting human creators whose work trained the models.

## Why Adopt

**For Providers:**

- Strengthens reputation for responsible automation

- Reduces risk of industrial action or community opposition

- Valuable in procurement and competitive bids

**For Deployers:**

- Lowers internal resistance to AI programmes

- Provides visible, auditable response to job displacement concerns

- Aligns with corporate social responsibility goals

**For Communities:**

- Ensures direct participation in automation benefits

- Creates resources for adaptation and innovation

- Builds sustainable transitions rather than abrupt displacement

## Relation to Other Commons

Value Commons complements:

- **Transparency Commons**: by requiring auditable accounting of gains

- **Governance Commons**: by creating stakeholder oversight structures

- **Reciprocity Commons**: by recognizing contributions along the value chain

## Implementation

This license can be adopted individually or combined with other Commons licenses. License holders may:

- Incorporate Value Commons clauses into master service agreements

- Add percentage-based value-sharing mechanisms to AI deployment contracts

- Establish transparent governance structures for fund management

- Define clear metrics for measuring and distributing automation gains
