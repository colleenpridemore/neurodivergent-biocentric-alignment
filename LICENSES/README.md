# BGINEXUS.io AI Commons Licenses

## Overview

This directory contains **six governance logics** for impact-oriented AI licensing, developed by the BGINEXUS.io AI Commons Licensing Lab. These licenses provide standardized, reusable clause patterns that can be embedded into AI licensing agreements, service contracts, and deployment terms to operationalize ethical commitments.

## The Six Commons

| Commons | Purpose | Key Mechanism |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **[Value](VALUE-COMMONS.md)** | Share automation gains | Routes percentage of AI-driven productivity gains to workers, communities, and shared infrastructures |
| **[Transparency](TRANSPARENCY-COMMONS.md)** | Standardize evidence | Creates reusable documentation and evaluations in common formats |
| **[Sustainability](SUSTAINABILITY-COMMONS.md)** | Account for ecology | Embeds energy/carbon measurement, reporting, and constraints |
| **[Access](ACCESS-COMMONS.md)** | Enable meaningful use | Reserves capacity for public-interest, research, and educational users |
| **[Reciprocity](RECIPROCITY-COMMONS.md)** | Recognize contributions | Routes value to data creators, annotators, and infrastructure providers |
| **[Governance](GOVERNANCE-COMMONS.md)** | Create oversight | Establishes multi-stakeholder boards with authority over AI systems |

## How to Use

### Individual Adoption

Each Commons license can be adopted independently:

- **Need to address job displacement?** → Use **Value Commons**
- **Want to ensure environmental responsibility?** → Use **Sustainability Commons**
- **Need stakeholder accountability?** → Use **Governance Commons**
- **Want to support public interest access?** → Use **Access Commons**
- **Need to credit data contributors?** → Use **Reciprocity Commons**
- **Want standardized reporting?** → Use **Transparency Commons**

### Combined Adoption

The licenses are designed to work together for comprehensive impact governance:

#### Example Combinations

**Responsible Automation Package:**

- Value Commons (share productivity gains)
- Transparency Commons (document impacts)
- Governance Commons (stakeholder oversight)

**Ecological AI Package:**

- Sustainability Commons (environmental accounting)
- Access Commons (support climate research)
- Transparency Commons (public reporting)

**Fair Data Economy Package:**

- Reciprocity Commons (compensate contributors)
- Value Commons (share downstream value)
- Governance Commons (contributor representation)

**Complete Impact Framework:**

- All six Commons for comprehensive ethical AI governance

## Integration into Contracts

These licenses are designed to be embedded into:

1. **Open Source Licenses**: Extend MIT, Apache, or GPL with Commons clauses
2. **Commercial Licenses**: Add Commons terms to proprietary software agreements
3. **Service Agreements**: Integrate into cloud/API terms of service
4. **Procurement Contracts**: Require Commons compliance for public sector AI
5. **Platform Terms**: Embed in marketplace or infrastructure provider agreements

### Sample Integration Points

```markdown
Section 4.2: Value Distribution
This Agreement incorporates the Value Commons license (v1.0).
Deployer agrees to channel [X]% of documented automation savings
into the Transition Fund as specified in Exhibit B.

Section 5.1: Environmental Accountability  
This Agreement incorporates the Sustainability Commons license (v1.0).
Provider commits to [requirements from Sustainability Commons template].

Section 6.3: Stakeholder Governance
This Agreement incorporates the Governance Commons license (v1.0).
The parties establish the Oversight Board with composition and powers
as specified in Schedule C.
```

## Alignment with Neurodivergent-Biocentric Framework

These Commons operationalize the values of the Neurodivergent-Biocentric AI Alignment theory:

| Framework Principle | Relevant Commons |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **Neurodivergent-Centered Design** | Transparency (document diverse cognitive impacts), Governance (include neurodivergent voices) |
| **Biocentric Value Alignment** | Sustainability (ecological limits), Access (support environmental research) |
| **Compassionate Intelligence** | Value (support affected workers), Reciprocity (fair compensation), Governance (stakeholder voice) |

## Legal Status

These licenses are:

- ✅ **Open Source**: Free to use, modify, and distribute
- ✅ **Modular**: Use individually or in combination
- ✅ **Contractually Enforceable**: Designed to work within existing legal frameworks
- ✅ **Standardized**: Reusable patterns that gain value through adoption
- ⚠️ **Experimental**: Emerging governance mechanisms, seek legal counsel for implementation
