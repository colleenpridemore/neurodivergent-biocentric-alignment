# Transparency Commons License

## Purpose

The Transparency Commons logic creates standardized evidence of AI system behavior, making documentation and evaluations reusable across deployments. It addresses the challenge that transparency obligations are often negotiated bilaterally, resulting in fragmented, incompatible reporting that cannot accumulate into shared knowledge.

## Core Principle

Transparency Commons clauses mandate that specific documentation about AI system behavior, performance, and impacts be produced in standardized formats and made available to defined stakeholder groups or public repositories. This allows evidence to accumulate across contracts into a shared transparency infrastructure.

## Key Mechanisms

### Standardized Documentation

- Common formats for model cards, datasheets, and evaluation reports

- Interoperable schemas for cross-system comparison

- Machine-readable metadata for automated analysis

### Evidence Accumulation

- Systematic collection of performance metrics across deployments

- Longitudinal tracking of system behavior over time

- Aggregated benchmarks for sector-wide learning

### Stakeholder Access

- Tiered access to documentation based on role and need

- Public repositories for general accountability

- Specialized access for regulators, auditors, and affected communities

## Application Scenarios

### 1. Content Moderation Systems

Platform operators commit to publishing quarterly reports on content-moderation AI decisions, false-positive rates across demographic groups, and appeals outcomes in standardized formats.

### 2. Scientific Discovery AI

Research institutions using AI for drug design publish standardized documentation of model architecture, training data provenance, validation results, and decision-making processes.

### 3. HR Analytics

Organizations using AI for hiring or pay equity analysis provide employees and regulators with standardized reports on model inputs, outputs, bias testing, and human override rates.

## Why Adopt

**For Providers:**

- Demonstrates commitment to responsible AI

- Builds trust with clients and regulators

- Creates competitive advantage through transparency leadership

**For Deployers:**

- Enables meaningful accountability to stakeholders

- Facilitates compliance with emerging regulations

- Supports internal governance and risk management

**For Society:**

- Builds shared knowledge about AI system behavior

- Enables cross-system learning and improvement

- Strengthens democratic oversight of AI deployment

## Key Requirements

### Documentation Must Include

- System capabilities and limitations

- Training data characteristics and provenance

- Performance metrics across relevant populations

- Known failure modes and edge cases

- Human oversight and intervention protocols

- Updates and changes over time

### Reporting Frequency

- Baseline documentation at deployment

- Regular updates (quarterly, annual, or event-triggered)

- Incident reports for significant failures or harms

### Accessibility

- Published in accessible formats

- Provided in multiple languages where appropriate

- Made available through standard repositories or registries

## Relation to Other Commons

Transparency Commons enables:

- **Value Commons**: by providing auditable evidence of automation impacts

- **Sustainability Commons**: by documenting ecological costs

- **Governance Commons**: by supporting informed stakeholder oversight

- **Reciprocity Commons**: by tracing contribution chains
