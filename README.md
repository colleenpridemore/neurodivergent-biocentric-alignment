# Neurodivergent-Biocentric AI Alignment

**A framework for achieving compassionate, universally beneficial AI**

*This is my original theory for AI alignment that centers neurodivergent perspectives and biocentric values.*

## Overview

The Neurodivergent-Biocentric AI Alignment Strategy proposes a fundamentally different approach to AI alignment—one that moves beyond anthropocentric frameworks to embrace the full spectrum of consciousness and life.

Traditional AI alignment focuses narrowly on aligning AI with "human values," often implicitly assuming neurotypical, human-centric perspectives. This theory argues that truly beneficial AI must:

1. **Center neurodivergent perspectives** as equally valid ways of experiencing and understanding the world
2. **Embrace biocentric values** that respect all forms of life, not just human interests
3. **Foster compassion** as a core principle rather than mere utility maximization

## Core Principles

### 1. Neurodivergent-Centered Design
- Recognize that neurodivergent cognition offers unique insights into intelligence, consciousness, and value
- Design AI systems that accommodate and celebrate cognitive diversity
- Reject the assumption that neurotypical human cognition is the "correct" baseline

### 2. Biocentric Value Alignment
- Extend moral consideration beyond humanity to all living systems
- Align AI with the flourishing of ecosystems, not just human economic interests
- Acknowledge that Earth's biosphere has intrinsic value independent of human utility

### 3. Compassionate Intelligence
- Build AI systems that prioritize care, empathy, and well-being
- Move beyond cold optimization toward understanding suffering and joy across different forms of consciousness
- Create technology that heals rather than exploits

## Why This Matters

Current AI alignment approaches risk encoding narrow, neurotypical, anthropocentric values into systems that will shape our collective future. By contrast, this framework:

- **Prevents harm** to neurodivergent individuals and non-human life
- **Enriches AI capabilities** by drawing on diverse cognitive perspectives
- **Creates sustainable outcomes** by respecting ecological limits and relationships
- **Builds truly beneficial AI** that serves life in all its forms

## Implementation Approach

1. **Diverse Input**: Include neurodivergent voices and ecological perspectives in AI development
2. **Value Pluralism**: Design reward functions that balance multiple stakeholders, including non-human interests
3. **Compassion Metrics**: Develop measures of well-being that go beyond human-defined utility
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously adapt based on feedback from affected communities and ecosystems

## About

This theory represents my perspective on how we can create AI that truly benefits all forms of consciousness and life on Earth. I believe that centering marginalized perspectives—including neurodivergent minds—and extending moral consideration to all living beings is not just ethically right, but essential for building AI that is genuinely aligned with flourishing rather than exploitation.
