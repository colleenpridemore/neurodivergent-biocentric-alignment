## Abstract

Fine-tuning AI with consideration for neurodivergent cognition could lead to more flexible, adaptive, and inclusive AI models that better understand and interact with a wider range of human experiences. Integrating biocentric empathy into fine-tuning could result in AI systems that prioritize the well-being of all living things, leading to more environmentally conscious and ethically aligned AI. The combination of these two perspectives has the potential to steer AI development towards a future where intelligence is not only advanced but also compassionate and universally beneficial.

The concepts of neurodivergent cognition and biocentric empathy introduce fascinating and complex considerations for fine-tuning AI, pushing towards more inclusive, ethical, and potentially robust AI systems. While direct research explicitly linking all three concepts ("neurodivergent cognition," "biocentric empathy," and "AI fine-tuning") is still emerging, we can explore how each element, and their intersection, could influence the process.

## 🌐 Application: Commons Logics Framework

This theory provides the core justification for new, standardized clause families designed for **impact-oriented AI licensing**. These clauses are intended to be enforced through collective action and governance mechanisms.

### Core Commons Logics Proposed:

* **Transparency Commons:** Mandating documentation reflecting **neurodivergent cognitive responses** to the AI system.
* **Reciprocity Commons:** Routing value back to diverse contributors, specifically those providing **neurodivergent expertise** and **biocentric data**.
* **Governance Commons:** Creating multi-stakeholder oversight bodies that include **neurodivergent groups** and **environmental/ecological experts**.
